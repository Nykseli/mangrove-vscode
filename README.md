# Visual Studio Code extension for Mangrove

This is the official repository for [Mangrove](https://github.com/mangrove-lang/mangrove)'s VS Code extension.

Currently it supports basic syntax highlighting and checks for valid syntax.
In future more features like code formatting will be added.

**Please note that everything is still unstable and very much in progress**

## Installation

Since it's still early days for the Mangrove project, we do not publish the extension to the market place yet. However, you can install the extension directly from the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mangrove-lang/mangrove-vscode
cd mangrove-vscode
npm install
npm run installDevExtension
```
